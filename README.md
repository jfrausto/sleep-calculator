# Sleep Cycle Calculator

I made this website to present a minimalistic sleep calculator with some extra utility. Calculate your sleep cycles, learn a little bit about how we sleep, and read up on some recent sleep-related articles scraped from the web.

## Tools

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- tRPC
- Framer Motion

## Inspiration

During my undergrad years at UCSD, I would use [sleepyti.me](https://sleepopolis.com/calculators/sleep/), now known as 'Sleepopolis.com', to calculate when I should wake up.
It was to the point and good looking. I wanted to emulate something like that while adding some utility.
